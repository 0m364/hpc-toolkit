## Description

This module will create startup-script runner that will execute Ramble commands.

Ramble is a multi-platform experimentation framework capable of driving
software installation, acquiring input files, configuring experiments, and
extracting results. For more information about ramble, see:
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ramble

This module outputs a startup script runner, which can be added to a collective
startups script to execute a set of ramble commands.

For this module to be completely functionaly, it depends on a spack
installation. For more information, see HPC-Toolkitâ€™s Spack module.

> **_NOTE:_** This is an experimental module and the functionality and
> documentation will likely be updated in the near future. This module has only
> been tested in limited capacity.

# Examples

## Basic Example

```yaml
- id: spack
  source: community/modules/scripts/spack-install
- id: ramble-setup
  source: community/modules/scripts/ramble-setup
- id: ramble-execute
  source: community/modules/scripts/ramble-execute
  use: [spack, ramble-setup]
  settings:
    commands:
    - ramble list
```

This example shows installing spack and ramble with their own modules
(spack-install and ramble-setup respectively). Then the ramble-execute module
is added to simply list all applications ramble knows about.
