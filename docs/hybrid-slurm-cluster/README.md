# Hybrid Slurm Clusters

## [inter-gcp-project-hybrid-slurm.md](./inter-gcp-project-hybrid-slurm.md)
This document describes how to deploy a simulated hybrid slurm cluster entirely
in GCP. These instructions can be used as a way of trying the
[schedmd-slurm-gcp-v5-hybrid](../../community/modules/scheduler/schedmd-slurm-gcp-v5-hybrid/README.md)
in GCP before bringing the configuration changes to a physical on-premise slurm
cluster.

## Blueprints
The [blueprints directory](./blueprints/) contains a set of support blueprints
for the documentation in this directory. These blueprints are intended to be
used as is with minimal tweaking of deployment variables either in place or on
the command line.
